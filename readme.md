# Welcome to Frisbee match finder!
## this project is barely in the incubating stages!

For now this is just a marriage of google maps and weather underground web apis. To get started, clone and add a keys.js file to the js folder that looks like this 

```
var config = {
  goog_key : a valid google maps api key,
  wu_key : a valid weather underground api key
}
```

and open index.html!
